# What is Contract Rummy?

"Contract rummy" is a card game favorite among my extended family. It's probably called something else by others, but we've been playing the following for years:

# Big picture
Contract Rummy is a game about building sets of cards. Players use a starting "hand" of cards, to which they add by Drawing and diminish by Laying Down and Discarding. On a given "Hand" of play (not to be )

# PrePendix: Card set types
There are two types of card sets:
- **group**: 3 or more cards of the same "rank" (ordinal value, that is).  
- - **example**: 3 of clubs, 3 of spades, 3 of hearts
- - **example**: 5 of spades, 5 of spades, 5 of hearts
- - - doesn't matter if you've got multiple of the same suit.
- - **example**: King of diamonds, King of hearts, King of Clubs, King of Hearts
- - - at least 3, not exactly 3
- - **example**: 2 of spades, 4 of diabmonds, 4 of clubs
- - - 2 is wild here, standing in as a 4 of spades

- **run**: 4 or more cards of same suit which form a sequencial series.

- - **example**: 5, 6, 7, 8 of spades
- - **example**: Ace, 2, 3, 4 of hearts 
- - - Ace can be either a "1" or a "14", but can't cross over
- - **example**: 9, 2, Jack, Queen, King of diamonds 
- - - 2 is standing in as a 10

## Note: wilds
Jokers and 2's are both wild. A joker can be anything, while a 2 can only stand in for another card of it's rank. 
- a 2 of clubs can be any club, but can't participate in a Run of hearts

# Contracts
Each hand in a game has a "contract". That is, a specific set of groups and runs which each player must construct before as a part of laying down. Something like "two runs" or "a group and a run". There's a specific logic to which contracts are played when which is irrelevant here for now. 
Each player aims to fulfill the contract so that they can then play the remainder of their cards on other people's laid down sets. 
Note that only the sets stipulated by the contract can exist on the table at a given time: if the contract is two runs, you can't lay down a group even if you've fulfilled your contract already. 

# Winning, etc
A player wins a hand by laying down all their cards. Once this occurs, play immediately stops and each other player's remaining hand is tabulated to a score for that hand. Scoring is as follows:

## scoring
- Face cards & 10s: 10 points
- Aces & 2's: 20 points
- Jokers: 50 points
- all other cards: face value (i.e. 7 of clubs is worth 7 points).
